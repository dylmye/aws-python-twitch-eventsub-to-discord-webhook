# Serverless Framework Python Twitch EventSub to Discord Webhook on AWS

This template takes go-live events from Twitch EventSub, and publishes the events through a Discord Webhook

## Usage

### Deployment

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-python-twitch-eventsub-to-discord-webhook to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-python-twitch-eventsub-to-discord-webhook-dev (140s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  handler: aws-python-twitch-eventsub-to-discord-webhook-dev-webhook (2.3 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

**Prerequisites:**

* A [Twitch Developer app](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/)
* An API client, like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download)
* 5 minutes of your time

You need to [subscribe your deployment to a Twitch Event](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub). For our use case here, we want to subscribe to [`stream.online`](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/eventsub-subscription-types/#streamonline) for a specific channel. Instructions on how to do this are available as [step 7 and step 8 in this guide](https://dylmye.me/2021/03/08/twitch-discord/). The `transport.callback` value should be the `endpoint` from the deploy output above.

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function handler
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"executed\": False,\n  \"rqid\": \"\"\n}"
}
```

Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
